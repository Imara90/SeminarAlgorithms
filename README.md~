Course TU Delft considering replanning algorithms

### Done: 
- Determine goal 
- Change titel to fit goal
- Find second paper to focus on
- Contact authors of the paper

### Todo still:
- Determine hypotheses for the paper
- Identify different ways of solving problems
- Identify weak point in state of the art
- Describe experiment / create roadmap
- Develop a domain and argument why this is better than current domains (has to be scalable)
- Write domain in PDDL
- Stimulate fails either online vs offline
- Experiment by tweeking the current algorithms
- Describe foundings of the experiment
- Try to adjust
- Conclude
- Future works
